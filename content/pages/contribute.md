# Contributing

Each resource listed in this site is defined by a markdown file in the [content/projects](https://github.com/marcosmro/covid19-repos/tree/master/content/projects) folder. 

Everybody is welcome to contribute to COVID19Repos.com, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marcosmro/covid19-repos), add a markdown file for the resource that you want to add, and send a pull request. Use our [resource template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcosmro/covid19-repos/master/content/resource_template/template.md) as a reference to know what information you need to provide for your resource. 
 
We reserve the right to accept or reject any opened pull requests. We'll only accept pull requests updating current resources or adding new resources that are clearly related to COVID-19. New resources must comply with the following requirements:
 
- **Accessible on GitHub:** The resource must have a public repository on GitHub that we can link to and pull in stats from.
- **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static site generators in [content/projects](https://github.com/marcosmro/covid19-repos/tree/master/content/projects). Use our [resource template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcosmro/covid19-repos/master/content/resource_template/template.md) as a reference to know what fields are required and optional, and to check the values accepted for each field.
