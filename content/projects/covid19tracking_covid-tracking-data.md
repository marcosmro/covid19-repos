The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. We attempt to report positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested for each state or district currently reporting that data.

This repository contains CSV representations of data from the Covid Tracking API.
