description: Collection of analyses, packages, visualisations of COVID19 data in R

---

This repo links to a collection of analyses on and representations of COVID19 data in R. Inclusion on the list does not mean the analysis was verified by me or that I endorse the findings. It should also be noted that some of the analysis / data might be out of date, so these should not be viewed, by default, as current findings.

I'm collecting them as they get posted online so that I can come back to them later to develop educational examples based on theses data. I should also note that one should think about using these as class examples thoroughly -- the situation is affecting all of us (and our students) greatly and it's possible some students are personally affected by the pandemic.

Subheadings are in flux as of now, as more analyses get added I might recategorize them.

If you have examples to add, please open an issue or make a pull request.
