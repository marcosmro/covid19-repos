This is a dashboard of network connections and clusters to track outbreak and transmission COVID19 in India. The primary data source is collected by volunteers at covid19india.org, a crowdsourced database collated from various news as well as government sources. This can be forked and connected to your Google sheet too. The intention of this graph is to open up options for analysis for policy/decision makers so that they can be more strategic in testing cases and deploying resources like ventilators, beds & medicines.
